= Homework: Implementation and Application of Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF)
:stem: latexmath
This homework focuses on implementing and applying the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) in various contexts. 
The tasks progress from a simple chaotic system (Lorenz system) to a more complex partial differential equation (PDE)-based model using finite element solutions as noisy observations.

== Objectives
- Explore the implementation of EnKF in Python libraries.
- Understand the principles of EnKF.
- Implement EnKF for a chaotic system (Lorenz system).
- Apply EnKF to finite element observations with a reduced-order model for prediction.

== Prerequisites
Familiarity with Python programming, basic numerical methods, and PDEs is recommended.

== Part 1: Understanding and Implementing EnKF
=== Task 1.1: Study EnKF Implementation in `filterpy`
Instructions::
+
1. Install and explore the `filterpy` library.
2. Study the implementation of EnKF in `filterpy`. Identify key components such as ensemble generation, prediction, and update steps.
3. Write a brief explanation of how the EnKF algorithm works, referencing the `filterpy` implementation.

Questions::
+
- How does the ensemble evolve over time in the EnKF algorithm?
- What role does the observation noise covariance matrix (stem:[R]) play in the update step?
- How does increasing the ensemble size affect the accuracy and computational cost?

== Part 2: Applying EnKF to the Lorenz System
The Lorenz system is a set of three coupled, nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that exhibit chaotic behavior under certain conditions. The equations are given by:

[stem]
++++
\dot{x} = \sigma(y - x) \\
\dot{y} = x(\rho - z) - y \\
\dot{z} = xy - \beta z
++++

with parameters:
- σ (sigma) = 10.0 (Prandtl number),
- ρ (rho) = 28.0 (Rayleigh number), and
- β (beta) = 8/3.

The system's chaotic nature makes it an excellent test case for data assimilation techniques.

=== Task 2.1: Model the Lorenz System
Instructions::
+
1. Implement the Lorenz system in Python using a high-order ODE solver. 
2. Solve the system for a fine time grid to generate the "truth."
3. Generate noisy observations by adding Gaussian noise to the "truth" at regular intervals.

Questions::
+
- How does the chaotic nature of the Lorenz system affect the EnKF's performance?
- What happens if the observation noise is underestimated or overestimated in the EnKF?

=== Task 2.2: Apply EnKF to the Lorenz System
Instructions::
+
1. Implement the EnKF for the Lorenz system using the noisy observations.
2. Use a coarser time step for the EnKF model to simulate practical limitations.
3. Compare the EnKF state estimates with the truth and noisy observations.
4. Study the effect of ensemble size:
   - Vary the ensemble size (e.g., 10, 50, 100, 200).
   - Measure and plot the root mean squared error (RMSE) of state estimates as a function of ensemble size.
   - Plot the computational time for different ensemble sizes and discuss trade-offs.
Questions::
+
- How does the time step of the model in the EnKF affect the filter's performance?
- What is the impact of ensemble size on the accuracy of state estimation?
- What are the computational costs associated with larger ensemble sizes?
- How do you determine an optimal ensemble size for balancing accuracy and efficiency?

== Part 3: Applying EnKF to a Finite Element Problem
=== Task 3.1: Generate Finite Element Solution
Instructions::
+
1. Use a finite element method (FEM) to solve the parabolic PDE associated with the heat conduction in the thermal fin of the first two homeworks. Use the finest grid possible.
2. Extract the average temperature at the root of the fin over time as the "truth."
3. Add Gaussian noise to the observations to simulate noisy sensors.

Questions::
+
- What challenges arise in using noisy FEM solutions as observations?
- How can observation noise be estimated in practical scenarios?

=== Task 3.2: Apply EnKF to FEM Observations Using Reduced Basis Model

==== Instructions

1. Construct a reduced-order model (ROM) of the FEM solution using a parabolic reduced basis:
   - Use Random-POD (proper orthogonal decomposition), where random sampling is performed in parameter space and POD is applied in time.
2. Use the FEM solution as the truth and add Gaussian noise to simulate noisy observations.
3. Use the ROM in the EnKF as the model for prediction.
4. Compare the EnKF estimates with the truth and noisy observations.
5. Analyze the trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency when using the reduced basis model versus the finite element method.

==== Questions

=== Accuracy Analysis

1. How do the state estimates from the EnKF using the reduced basis model compare to the true FEM solution?
   - Provide quantitative metrics such as the root mean square error (RMSE) or the mean absolute error (MAE) over time.
   - Discuss whether the EnKF accurately captures the temporal evolution of the system state.

2. How does the noise in the observations affect the accuracy of the EnKF state estimates?
   - Analyze the filter's sensitivity to observation noise levels (e.g., by repeating the experiment with varying noise standard deviations).
   - Comment on whether the reduced basis model amplifies or mitigates the impact of noise on the EnKF estimates.

=== Efficiency Analysis

3. What are the computational time and memory requirements for:
   - Running the EnKF with the reduced basis model.
   - Running the EnKF with the full FEM model.
   - Compare these results quantitatively (e.g., time per assimilation step, memory usage for state prediction).

4. How does the computational efficiency scale with the number of observations or ensemble size when using the reduced basis model versus the full FEM model?
   - Provide plots or tables illustrating scalability.

=== Trade-Offs and Limitations

5. What are the limitations of using a reduced basis model in the EnKF?
   - Discuss cases where the reduced basis model might fail to capture important dynamics of the FEM solution.
   - Identify situations where the reduced basis approximation could introduce biases in the state estimates.

6. What is the maximum dimension of the reduced basis space (stem:[N]) at which the reduced basis model remains computationally advantageous compared to the FEM model?
   - Analyze the balance between reduced basis model accuracy and computational cost as stem:[N] increases.

7. In practical applications, how would you decide between using a reduced basis model and the full FEM model for EnKF predictions?
   - Provide criteria or thresholds (e.g., based on available computational resources, desired accuracy).

==== Optional Exploration

8. How does the reduced basis model’s performance depend on the quality of the snapshot data used to construct it?
   - Experiment with varying numbers of parameter-time samples for the POD construction.
   - Discuss the importance of snapshot diversity in capturing system dynamics.

9. If the EnKF is applied to a different region of parameter space than used for constructing the reduced basis, how does this affect the filter's performance?
   - Investigate whether the reduced basis generalizes well to unseen parameter combinations.

10. Can the reduced basis model be enhanced (e.g., by adaptively adding basis functions during the EnKF runtime) to address limitations?
    - Propose a simple adaptive scheme and discuss its potential impact on accuracy and efficiency.
