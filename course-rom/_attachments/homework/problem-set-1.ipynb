We thus investigate the reduced-basis methods that allow us to accurately and very rapidly predict $T_{\\mathrm{root}} (\\mu)$ in the limit of many evaluations — that is, at many different values of $\\mu$ — which is precisely the limit of interest in design and optimization studies. To derive the reduced-basis approximation we shall exploit the energy principle,\n","\n$$\nu(\\mu) = \\mathop{\\mathrm{argmin}}_{w \\in X} J(w),\n$$\n","where $J(w)$ is given by (#eq:2).\n","To begin, we introduce a sample in parameter space, latexmath:[S_N = \\{\\mu_1 ,\n","  \\mu_2 ,\\ldots, \\mu_N \\}] with $N \\ll \\mathcal{N}$.

Recall that $W_N = \\mathop{\\mathrm{span}}\\{\\xi^i , i = 1,\\ldots, N \\}$ means that $W_N$ consists of all functions in $X$ that can be expressed as a linear combination of the $\\xi^i$ ; that is, any member $v_N$ of $W_N$ can be represented as\n","\n$$\nv_N =\\sum_{i=1}^N \\beta^j \\xi^j ,\n$$\n","for some unique choice of latexmath:[\\beta^j \\in \\mathbb{R}, j = 1,\\ldots,\n","N]. (We implicitly assume that the $\\xi^i , i = 1,\\ldots, N$, are linearly independent; it follows that $W_N$ is an $N$ -dimensional subspace of $X^\\mathcal{N}$.) In the reduced-basis approach we look for an approximation $u_N (\\mu)$ to $u^\\mathcal{N} (\\mu)$ (which for our purposes here we presume is arbitrarily close to $u^e (\\mu))$ in $W_N$ ; in particular, we express $u_N (\\mu)$ as\n","\n$$\nu_N (\\mu) =\\sum_{i=1}^N u^j_N \\xi^j ;\n$$\n","we denote by latexmath:[%\n","  u_N (\\mu) \\in \\mathbb{R}^N] the coefficient vector $(u^1_N ,\\ldots, u^N_N )^T$.

And how good is it? And how do we compute our approximation efficiently? The energy principle is crucial here (though more generally the weak form would suffice).
