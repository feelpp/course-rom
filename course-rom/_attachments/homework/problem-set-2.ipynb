In the offline stage we require the finite element solution to build the reduced basis and we thus also need the FE matrices. In this problem set we skip the FE assembly step and provide all of the necessary data for use in Python (see Appendix 1).\n","We saw in class that the reduced basis solution $u_N ( \\mu ) \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ satisfies the set of $N\\times N$ linear equations,\n","\n$$\n  A_N( \\mu )u_N( \\mu ) = F_N;\n$$\n","and that the outputis given by\n","\n$$\n  {T_{root}}_N ( \\mu ) = L^T_N u_N ( \\mu ).\n$$\n","We derived expressions for $A_N( \\mu ) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times N}$ in terms of $A_N( \\mu )$ and $Z$, $F_N \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ in terms of $F_N$ and $Z$, and $L_N \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ in terms of $L_N$ and $Z$; here $Z$ is an $\\mathcal{N} \\times N$ matrix, the jth column of which is $u_N ( \\mu j )$ (the nodal values of $u_N ( \\mu j ))$. Finally, it follows from affine parameter dependence that $A_N ( \\mu )$ can be expressed as\n","\n$$\nA_N( \\mu ) =  \\sum_{q=1}^Q \\Theta^q( \\mu )A^q_N.\n$$\n","The goal is to implement an offline/ online version of the reduced – basis method following the computational decomposition indicated below.\n","\n","- Offline\n","\n","1.

Generate the reduced basis matrix $Z$ and all necessary reduced basis quantities. You have two options: you can use the solution \"snapshots\" directly in $Z$ or perform a Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization to construct $Z$ (Note that you require the $X$ – inner product to perform Gram-Schmidt; here, we use $(\\cdot, \\cdot)_X = a(\\cdot, \\cdot; \\mu )$, where $\\mu = 1$ – all conductivities are $1$ and the Biot number is $0.1$). Calculate the condition number of $A_N ( \\mu )$ for $N = 8$ and for $\\mu = 1$ and $\\mu = 10$ with and without Gram – Schmidt orthonormalization. What do you observe? Solve the reduced basis approximation (where you use the snapshots directly in $Z$) for $\\mu_1 = 0.1$ and $N = 8$. What is $u_N( \\mu_1)$? How do you expect $u_N( \\mu_2)$ to look like for $\\mu_2\n= 10.0$? What about $\\mu_3 = 1.0975$? Solve the Gram – Schmidt orthonormalized reduced basis approximation for $\\mu_1 = 0.1$ and $\\mu\n2 = 10$ for $N = 8$. What do you observe? Can you justify the result?

The Biot number is directly related to the cooling method; higher cooling rates (higher $Bi$) imply lower (better) ${T_{root}}$ but also higher (worse) initial and operational costs.

Apply your (online) reduced – basis approx – imation for ${T_{root}}_N$ (that is, replace ${T_{root}}(Bi)$ in ([above](#eq:CBi)) with ${T_{root}}_N (Bi))$ to find the optimal $Bi.$ Any (simple) optimization procedure suffices for the minimization.\n","\n","1.
